### ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project involves the design and simulation of a **4-bit synchronous counter** using digital logic. 
Alongside the standard counter, I also implemented a **2Ã— ticking counter** â€” a counter that increments at twice the rate of the original 4-bit counter **without altering the input clock frequency**. 
The doubling effect was achieved using logic-based frequency multiplication techniques, ensuring synchronous operation and consistent timing. Both designs were simulated and verified using **LTspice**, with attention to propagation delays, setup/hold times, and stable toggling behavior.
